Instructions to Set Up the Crow Backend and Frontend

Prerequisites

Installation Steps

1. Install Dependencies

For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++ cmake libboost-all-dev libssl-dev

For Arch-based systems:

sudo pacman -S gcc boost openssl

2. Install Crow

Crow is header-only. Clone it into your project or system:

git clone https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow.git

Alternatively, you can install it globally or just copy the Crow include/ folder into your project directory.

How to Run

3. Compile the Backend

In the folder where server.cpp is located:

g++ server.cpp -o server -I/path/to/crow/include -lboost_system -lpthread -lssl -lcrypto

Note:
Replace /path/to/crow/include with the actual path where you placed Crow's include folder.

For example, if your project looks like this:

/project
  ├── include/ (contains crow_all.h)
  ├── server.cpp
  └── index.html

Then the compile command would be:

g++ server.cpp -o server -Iinclude -lboost_system -lpthread -lssl -lcrypto

4. Run the Backend Server

./server

By default, it will start serving at:

http://localhost:18080/

You should see a message like:

Server is running at http://localhost:18080/

How to Link Backend and Frontend

1. Open index.html file in a code editor.


2. Make sure all fetch URLs in index.html point to http://localhost:18080.


3. Simply open index.html in your browser.


4. Now, the frontend will send HTTP requests to your C++ server running Crow.

Important Notes

Keep the server running while testing the frontend.

Ensure your browser does not block localhost requests (disable strict CORS settings if needed).

If you move to a public deployment, you must secure your server (use HTTPS).

The backend must be recompiled after every code change.
